## Questions

1. In your own words, why do we use Git?

We use Git too keep an up-to-date version of code stored in the cloud/ not just locally. Also, when we push content up to git, a time stamp and tag of who submitted that information are stored, meaning that multiple developers can work on the same project at the same time w/o confusing information.   

2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

Multiple branches are beneficial because they can be used to have a live version of a website while also developing a different brach/ version at the same time.

3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?

Git is a local repository that stores code on your device, while Github is a remote repository that you can push information to from Git, that will then be stored in the cloud to be accessed by the same or different device at a later time.
