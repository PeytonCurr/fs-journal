## Questions

1. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?

A pseudo-class is a class that can be added on to an element that describes a special state that an element might be in. Some common ones that I think I might use are :hover, :fullscreen, and :autofill.

2. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificity is the order in which styles in CSS will be applied/ over-ruled. You may use it to you benefit by being able to put designs on general things like all "div's", while giving specific/ conflicting design to one particular "div".   

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?

You might run into problem like not being able to find out why a certain style isn't being applied to your item. The reason that curtain style isn't being applied is that it is being overridden by a "!important" somewhere.
