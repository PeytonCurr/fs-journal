## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip for improving your design? How does it benefit your site?

My favorite tip for improving my design was to use shading/ bolding to give the illusion of size increase or decrease, as apposed to increasing pixel size.

2. Compile a couple of resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

apple.com is probably one of the best designed websites I can find, but it is decently over the top in many areas. Also, amazon.com is a great example of an extremely functionally designed website.

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

Good design influences people a ton when visiting a website. For example, you could convey importance with good design which could make someone possibly be more likely to buy an item that you made seem important.
