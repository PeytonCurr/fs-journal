## Questions

1. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?

Wireframing is setting up an outline for how you want you future website to be designed, before you start coding it.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames, and why is each one useful?

The three different levels of detail in wire-frames are called low, mid, and high-fidelity wire-framing. The low detail is important because, they can be used to help hash out broad ideas without spending too much time discussing. The mid-fidelity wire-framing is important because, they can be used to show a much more detailed version of the website layout without putting all the information into the website. The high-fidelity wire-framing is important because it provides a replica of a website that a software engineer could then clone into a working website.

3. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?

I think that wire-frames are most definitely worth the time if the correct type is used at the correct time. For example high-fidelity wire-framing is extremely helpful when working with multiple different teams in a work place (design team / software engineer team)

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

One take away from todays assignment was that it collaborating with others is extremely helpful with coding. The ability to share knowledge where one person may think of a bug fix that another wouldn't have makes the coding process much more efficient.
