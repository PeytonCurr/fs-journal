# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
I think that the class getting to know each other and all feel like we are battling the struggles together has gone great, and it already feels like we are part of a team. 

- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
I think the ease that bootstrap provided was quite the surprise, as it almost entirely takes out the need for designing your own classes in CSS.

- What are you struggling with?
I'd say that one this I am struggling with is knowing when to use specific css/ bootstrap properties to size various objects. I often find myself using a css property that worked to size an img for example to try to size an Icon.

- What would you count as a victory?
What I would count as a victory is successfully coding a difficult concept in my brain. When I am able to display what I was trying to onto the webpage I feel a small sense of victory every time.
