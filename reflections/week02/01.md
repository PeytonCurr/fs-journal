## Questions

1. What is ***scope***?

Scope is the area within the code where information is being stored. For example, when you define a variable with Var outside of a function it has a global scope. 

2. What is ***Hoisting***?

Hoisting is a mechanism in Java script that causes a function that has not yet been initialized to be hoisted to the top of its scope, and initialized with a value of undefined. 

3. In what cases might you use `let` vs. `const` vs. `var`?

"Let" is preferred for variable declaration, and should be used in most causes. "Let" is block defined, and it can't be re-defined. Also, "Let" can't be used before defining,because it is not initialized upon being hoisted. You might choose to use "Var" in place of "Let" to counter act this. "Var" is initially initialized upon hoisting which means you can use it before declaring it. "Const" is special where is can't be updated or re-defined, and also can't be declared without being initialized. "Const" is also not initialized during hoisting.
