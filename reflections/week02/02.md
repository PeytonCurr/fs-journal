## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

The Three ways to syntactically write a function are with Function Declarations, Function Expressions, and Arrow Function Expressions. Function Declarations are hoisted and thus can be used before they are defined, while function expressions & Arrow function expressions are not. Arrow Function expressions are a shorter way of writing function expressions.

2. What is the main difference between ***parameters*** and ***arguments***?

The Main difference between parameters and arguments is that parameters are names that are created in the function declaration, while arguments are values that the function receives from the parameters. 

3. What are ***higher-order functions***? Can you provide an example?

A higher-order function is a function that accepts another function as its parameter, or returns another function. An example of a higher-order function is Array.prototype.map.
