## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style?

There are a couple main ways of writing information to the console: First by directly typing in code into the console, which can be helpful for testing out code from the webpage, and the second way is to write console.log() from within you code to receive an output on the console, which can be helpful for verifying that your code is working the way that you think it should. 

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS, and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

The Element tab is the tab that allows you to see a full breakdown of HTML and CSS. It can be useful when debugging HTML because you can error messages will pop up on the exact line where the error occurs, and you can make temporary changes to the HTML and instantly see the results of your change.  

3. Instead of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

A better way of debugging you code then just writing everything in the console is to add a debugger key word into you code that you can then use in the Javascript Debugger section to step through your code and more easily find errors.
