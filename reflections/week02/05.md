# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.


## Prompts
- What went well this week?

This Week I did really well at embracing the struggle, I definitely wasn't doing the best with JavaScript at the beginning of the week, but by the end of the checkpoint, I felt really confident. 

- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?

Something I learned that was a shock / surprise, was that javascript could be used to manipulate the DOM, buy using the functions .innerText and .innerHTML. 

- What are you struggling with?

I would say that I still am slightly struggling with CSS spacing, as I still find myself messing with different bootstrap properties not knowing which one specificity does what. 

- What would you count as a victory?

I would count my confidence increase with Javascript as a victory.
