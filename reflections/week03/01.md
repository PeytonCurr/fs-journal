## Questions

1. What problem does using ***exports*** solve?

Using exports solves the problem of having add multiple script tags to your HTML Document to have multiple javaScripts running in the same program (Which slows it down)

2. How does `export` differ from `export default`?

When just exporting a variable, that variable will need to be explicitly imported to be able to be use. On the other hand, when export defaulting a variable, simply importing the file will import that default, with whatever definition you so choose. 

3. What is a benefit of using the "module" system?

A benefit of using the module system is being able to reuse other scripts in you file there for increasing performance, and decreasing the chance of bugs.
