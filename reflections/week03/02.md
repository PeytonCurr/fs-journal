## Questions

1. What is the purpose of ***Encapsulation***?

The purpose of encapsulation is to collect curtain types of data into specific places that cant be accessed from outside that area. This helps make sure data is given single responsibility, and helps ensure that problems can be easier to locate.

2. What were some of the problems with ***closures*** and the ***underscore prefix*** convention?

Some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix convection is that you can run into breaking changes, and it makes it more difficult to have self-documenting code. For example if you use the underscore convention, you expect your user the know that they are not supposed to be interacting with that function, verses if you use encapsulation, they will not be able to interact to said function.  

3. How do we create private variables in an ES6 `Class`? Why would you do this?

We create private variables in an ES6 "Class" by having the stage-3 feature enabled. We do this too truly make a Class Private, without denoting it with an underscore, or using encapsulation.
