# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.


## Prompts
- What went well this week?

I think something that went well this week was that I left everyday with a good understanding of the topics that where introduced in that days lecture.

- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?

I learned that saving data to the Local storage was as easy as just using a saveState and loadState function.

- What are you struggling with?

I think that I am slightly struggling with encapsulation and understanding when to make certain things private, or when to make them available to certain files. 

- What would you count as a victory?

Something I would count as a victory is overcoming the struggle of leaning how to use MVC.
