> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of 'callback hell'?

Some signs of callback hell is having long pyramids of "})'s" cascading down at the end of one of your functions. The causes of callback hell is using callback functions, and assuming that the code will run top to bottom no matter what.

2. What does ***asynchronous*** mean, and how are callbacks involved?

Asynchronous means that what ever is being called takes some amount of time, and won't immediately run. Functions that use callbacks often are asynchronous/ take some time to produce a result. 

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid/fix 'callback hell.'

The Three ways to avoid/ fix callback hell is to 1. Keep your code Shallow 2. Modularize 3. Handle every single error. Keeping your code Shallow consists of keeping clean/ easily readable code. When keeping your code shallow, you should define every function or variable with accurate names that depict their function, and you should split up your functions into smaller functions that all preform their own job. When Modularizing, you should split up your Javascript into multiple different files that all have individual purposes, and functions should only be placed into that file if they align with that files purpose. A good way to handle your errors is to reserve the first argument of all of your callback functions for an error reader.
