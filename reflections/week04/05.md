# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.


## Prompts
- What went well this week?
I think this week the partner exercise went really well, and really helped to reinforce my confidence with this weeks content.
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
On thing that I learned tha I felt was a shock or surprise, was that using the array method splice, can make the process if editing an object in an array much simpler, and basically cut out a step. 
- What are you struggling with?
I was struggling with higher order functions, and running into problems with having variables being undefined, because the code that was supposed to initialize them, had not ran yet. 
- What would you count as a victory?
What I would count as a victory this week was that by the end of the week I was much more comfortable with this weeks material, and was able to think my way through the Checkpoint without going down many rabbit holes.
