## Questions

1. What is the purpose of a ***query string***?

The purpose of a query string is to add data to the end of an url that can be used as parameters or filters that will cause specific webpages to load. 

2. What is the format of a ***query parameter***? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?

A query parameter starts with a question mark at the end of the url, then provides a key=value. If there are multiple parameters then each one is separated by a `&`.

3. When do you think query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?

Parameter would be helpful when writing your server, when you are trying to section a certain collection of data off to only people that have a certain password. This password would be represented as a parameter in the url.
