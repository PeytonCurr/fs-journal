## Questions

1. What are the three types of data relationships?

The three types of data relationships are (1:1), (1:N), and (N:M)

2. What are the benefits of traditional ***linking*** relationships over ***embedding*** relationships?

The benefits that a traditional linking relationship would have over embedding relationships, is that they are able to account for large amounts of data more easily, as you can exceed the 16MB of data alloted to the embedding style, and they will each be called separately, in which case will load more quickly. 

3. When modeling data, it's important to consider how a user will use and filter that data. How does this affect the way you model a ***many-to-many*** relationship? 

Depending on how a user will use and filter the data will affect the way that it should be modeled. For example if the user plans to filter the data in such a way that there is an uneven relationship, it would make the most sense to use One-way Embedding.
