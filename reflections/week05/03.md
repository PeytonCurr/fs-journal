## Questions

1. In simple terms what is ***timeboxing***?

Time boxing is giving yourself a predetermined amount of time to complete a task, and if you are not able to complete it within that amount of time, you need to ask for help.

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

Three strategies I will implement are: 1. To ruthlessly apply, by making sure that I stop working on activities that are not the highest use of my time. 2. Knowing my Golden hour, by making sure to take rest and breaks when I feel that my Body/ Brain needs them, and to then get to work when I feel my best. 3. Prioritizing, by making sure I am giving the largest amount of time and effort to the most important tasks, while also giving adequate time to things that aren't meant to be completed like relationships. 

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 

An example of when I have benefitted from time boxing, is when I would be in lab and working on my project. I would start to go down a rabbit hole into trying to fix an issue that I thought would be an easy fix, so to get out of this rabbit hole before it sucked up my whole lab time, I would stop myself and ask for help from the TA's.
