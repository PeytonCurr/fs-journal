# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
Id say that the hackathon went really well this week, because it was a great time, and it made me ten fold more confident with the weeks material. 
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
Something that I leaned that was a shock or a surprise was how useful redesigning out your website before trying to code it is extremely helpful. This is not something I tend to do in my own projects, but during the hackathon, some of teammates wanted to, so we ended up making a model for the front and the backend before starting to code. 
- What are you struggling with?
I would say that I am still slightly struggling on the data relationships in the backend. 
- What would you count as a victory?
I would count our teams hackathon project as a victory, because we were able to get a lot of our project done and we worked together very well.
