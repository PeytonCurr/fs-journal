## Questions

1. What is ***Component-Based Architecture***?

Component Based-Architecture is a way of designing your code so that the many pieces of your User interface are broken into their own "micro systems" that operate independently. 

2. What are some benefits of Component-Based Architecture?

Some of the benefits of Component-Based Architecture are: The individual elements on the page can update independently without interfering the rest of the elements. Developers don't have to spend as much time trying to figure out what part of the codes UI contains what function (which can be particularly useful in debugging). Lastly, Components are reuseable, which makes righting small functioning applications that you know will be used multiple times much easier.

3. What are some drawbacks to Component-Based Architecture?

Component-Based Architecture can end up being bloated and polluted if used in areas when not needed (This would be considered over-engineering).
