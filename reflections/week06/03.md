## Questions

1. What are ***lifecycle hooks***? What are lifecycle hooks used for?

Lifecycle hooks are markers that track where along the lifecycle a component is. We use lifecycle hooks to preform a certain task during a specific point of the components lifecycle. 

2. How have you used lifecycle hooks in your afternoon projects?

I have used lifecycle hooks during my afternoon projects by initializing functions during the setup() of each of my components, and by using onMounted to run said functions when the component mounts.

3. What are ***mounting hooks***? When might you use them?

Mounting hooks allow you to access your component immediately before during or after it mounts. You might use a mounting hook when trying to draw components to the page upon load.
