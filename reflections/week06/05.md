# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

I think this week I did a good job of bouncing back from feeling a bit behind at the beginning of the week.

- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?

Something that I learned that was a shock or a surprise, was just how much easier creating the front end of the application can be with the framework Vue.

- What are you struggling with?

I feel like I am struggling a little with debugging, as sometimes I will get stuck with an error code, and I won't know where to look to solve the issue.

- What would you count as a victory?

I would count me being able to finish as much of the checkpoint as I did as a victory, as it was my Birthday this weekend, so it was an extremely busy weekend.
