## Questions

1. What is the ***user experience***? What should be considered when developing to create a good UX?

The user experience is everything that a user might experience when using your site. The user must be considered in every aspect of building your site.

2. What are some benefits of taking into account the user experience?

Taking user experience into account when building your site is beneficial because it leads to a more ascetically pleasing website that users are more likely to continue to visit.

3. Why is the user experience important?

The user experience is important, because at the end of the day the user is the reason you built the site, and if the user is having a bad experience, then in a sense you have a bad site.
