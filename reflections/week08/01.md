## Questions

1. What function does a ***developer portfolio*** provide?

A developer portfolio provides a great way for a developer to show off their skills.

2. What makes a developer portfolio effective?

What makes a developer portfolio effective can be boiled down to efficiently showing off the skills you have by providing quality projects that will help you do that.

3. What projects do you have that you would include in your portfolio? Why?

I would add my "Moon Miner Project", because I think that it did a good job of showing off my creative logical problem solving, and I would also show off my "ToDo's App", because I think that it is a very helpful app, that is also good to look at.
