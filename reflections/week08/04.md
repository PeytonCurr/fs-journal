## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

The three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue are: Unit Testing, which allows you to test every unit of code in isolation. Component Testing, which allows you to narrow down on specific elements  of the page that might be having issues. End-to-End(E2E) Testing, which allows you to look over the application itself to see if it is functioning in its entirety. 

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

I think that competent based testing would be the most useful, because it allows you to breakdown and test you code in smaller digestible pieaces, without getting overly detailed.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

I would think that unit based testing is the least useful, because as long as you test every component on the page, there is little reason to need to go more in depth than that.
