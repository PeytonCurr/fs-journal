# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
I think that this week my team did a very good job of exchanging and debating ideas to come up with the best idea for an application we could.
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
Something that I learned that was a shock was that with the API we chose to use, we were forced to get "Refresh Tokens" which made us make a call to the API every 30 minutes to keep our API key up to date.
- What are you struggling with?
I have been struggling with balancing trying to get deeply invested into the section of the code I am supposed to be working on, and also trying to take on different responsibilities to ensure that I am not missing out on any learning opportunities. 
- What would you count as a victory?
What I would count as a victory was our team being able to share and debated each-others ideas, until we came up with what we all agreed was the best Idea for an app as we could, and then making great strides to make that app functional.
