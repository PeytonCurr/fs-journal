## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

We are using Vue and Bootstrap for our front End, and are using Node in our backend.

2. What went well so far?

I think that our planning went extremely well, because it laid out a very clear rode map for us to start working on our project.

3. What would you do differently? Why?

I think that If I could restart the whole project I would have had the basic design/ color pallet of the project, because it is not the most beautiful site.
