## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

The three categories of data types are a value types, reference types, and pointer types. A value type is a data type that holds its data value within its own memory space. A reference type is a data type where the instead of storing its value directly, it holds a reference address of where that data is stored in memory. A pointer type is a data type that does not hold any data or address to data. 

2. What are the ***value-type*** data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

The value type data types are: Bool, Byte, Char, Decimal, Double, Enum, Float, Int, Long, Sbyte, Short, Short, Struct, Unit, Ulong, Ushort. they are different from Javascript, because, in Javascript the only types you use to declare variables are const, var, and let.

3. In your own words how do ***reference types*** get stored in memory? How does this differ from value types?

Reference types get stored in data in a random data location, and store a data location of a value type in memory. The differ from value types because value types store the value of data within there own memory.
