## Questions

1. What is an ***Enum***, and what are some use cases for them?

An enum is a list of Strongly typed constants meaning that all items in the list share a type, and can not be redefined. 

2. How can you modify an Enum?

You can modify the value of an enum in two different ways, you can change the base type of the enum, or you can change the base values of the enum.

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far? (if you have not yet, give an example of how you could.)

I could use enums in a situation where there is a set of related numbers in my code. I could replace these with enums.
