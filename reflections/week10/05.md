# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

Something that I would say went well this week was that I started learning C# and SQL.

- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?

Something that I learned that was a shock was that in SQL you are going the functions of the DataBase manually, as apposed to with MongoDB (where it does it for you).

- What are you struggling with?

I would say that I was slightly struggling with using SQL, especially because it does not have any intellisense when writing it in C#.

- What would you count as a victory?

What I would count as a victory would be that in less than a week I have been able to learn, to a pretty decent level, how to use C# and SQL to build a websites backend.
