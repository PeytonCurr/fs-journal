## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `PRIMARY KEY` and a `FOREIGN KEY`

A primary Key is used on the Id that will be defining the instance of a table.

2. What is an ***alias***?

An Alias is a shortened version of the table name that can be used to more quickly call to multiple parts of the table.

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)
SELECT
doc.*
p.*
FROM doctors doc
JOIN patients p ON p.doctorId = doc.Id
WHERE doc.id = @Id
