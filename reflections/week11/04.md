## Questions

Review and reflect on your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your **final project**. What are your concerns? How do you plan to manage your time? What have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point?

I would say that I am concerned for the job search, as I am going to need an income in the near future, but I am fairly confident with my coding and interview skills, so I would say that I am specifically concerned about my application being overlooked, and not getting the opportunity to interview.
I plan on managing my time after school ends by working on my own projects, while simultaneously keeping up the job search. I plan on meeting up with past classmates to help build my skills in a group setting. I would say that what I enjoyed most about the course up to this point has been watching how fair I have come with my coding ability in such a sort amount of time.
