# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

I would say that what went well this week was being able to get a decent portion of my AllSpice project complete, so I will hopefully be prepared for the final.

- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?

I would say that something I learned that was a shock or a surprise was that in the Vue router you are able to put the filed "beforeEnter: authGuard" to make sure that the page will only load once your Auth0 account loads. This is important, because it means you can use "onMounted()" on a function that requires authorization as opposed to having to use a "watchEffect()".

- What are you struggling with?

I would say that I am struggling with balancing the carrier work with the coding work, as I feel like the carrier side of things has almost been entirely "on us" / unguided, so I find myself struggling.

- What would you count as a victory?

I would say that something I would count as a victory would be that I was able to do the portion of AllSpice (that I did complete), almost entirely on my own (With little help from TA's).
